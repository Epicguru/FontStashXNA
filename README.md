FontStashXNA is [FontStashSharp](https://github.com/rds1983/FontStashSharp) for MonoGame and FNA.
Or - in other words - it is the text rendering library with following features:

* Glyphs are rendered on demand on the texture atlas
* It's possible to have multiple ttf fonts per one FontSystem(i.e. one ttf with Latin characters, second with Japanese characters and third with emojis)
* Colored text
* Blurry and stroked text
